# App.xaml

Defines WPF application-level resources and the startup window.

Summary
- Standard WPF Application markup.
- Sets StartupUri to MainWindow.xaml.
- Central place to add resource dictionaries, styles, and theme resources if needed.

Why it matters
- Keeps global styles consistent across the UI.
- Controls which window is launched first.

Tips
- Add global styles or merged dictionaries here if you want cohesive theming across all views.
